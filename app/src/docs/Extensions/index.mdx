# Web3 Extension Assets

## Icons of popular Web3 wallet extensions, in SVG and TSX formats.

<NPM npm={props.npm} />

### SVG Icons

#### As some of the extension icons are not perfectly square, it is recommended to bound their width and heights with `max-width` and `max-height` properties.

<ExtensionsSvg />

### JSX Icons

#### The icons are also available as React components. Some frameworks require the assets to be locally available to lazily load them.
