# Account Card

## A card showing the account information with different areas for icon or a custom component

<NPM npm={props.npm} />

#### Introduction

The `AccountCard` recipe is meant to exist for quick and fast showing of account data (address, name, icon etc); It is excellent for lists of accounts to be shown. Below can be found the different properties that the `AccountCard` component receives as props, in order to depict the needed example.

The `AccountCard` with all possible props look like the following piece of code:

<AccountCardPageInfo />

##

# Simple Examples With or Without Icon

##

`iconProps` can be either fully filled or an empty object `{}`, that will make all params default (see above); In both cases a `PolkadotIcon` will appear.

<AccountCardPageSimple />

If `iconProps` is not provided no icon will appear; `Title` with `address` props are the minimum that need to be provided.

<AccountCardPageSimpleNoIcon />

Other `iconProps` can be either the `girdSize` (Recipe will automatically calculate the rest of the size of the main area `MainAreaGridSize = 12 - IconGridSize`).

<AccountCardPageSimpleMoreProps />

# Advanced Examples With Extra Params and Component

##

Amount of ellipsis can be set. When position, is `center`, then that amount corresponds to the left and to the right part of the text; If it is set to `left` or `right`, then it corresponds to the other side accordingly. (Defaults to `center`).

<AccountCardPageAdvanced />

When the amount of ellipsis is too small, the ellipsis will default to 4.

<AccountCardPageAdvancedEllipsis />

If an extreme ellipsis amount is provided, then the Recipe will reduce it, in order to show the maximum possible amount (calculating with: (address.length/2) - 3).

<AccountCardPageAdvancedEllipsisExtreme />

Extra component can be added; its default position is left. If icon position is also left, then the extra component always goes on the further side (same for right). Position, defaults to `left`; (recipe will automatically calculate the rest of the size of the main area based on: `MainAreaGridSize = 12 - IconGridSize - ExtraComponentGridSize`).

<AccountCardPageAdvancedExtraComponent />

Extra component can be added; Its default position is left; If icon position is also left, then the extra component always goes on the further side (same for right); Position, defaults to `left`; (Recipe will automatically calculate the rest of the size of the main area based on: `MainAreaGridSize = 12 - IconGridSize - ExtraComponentGridSize`).
